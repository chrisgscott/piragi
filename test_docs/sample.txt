        AsyncRagi Test Document
        
        This is a test document for the AsyncRagi FastAPI integration.
        
        Key features:
        - Async support for web frameworks
        - Non-blocking operations
        - Progress tracking with async iterators
        - Knowledge graph capabilities
        
        Usage examples:
        1. Use with FastAPI for high-performance web APIs
        2. Integrate with aiohttp for async web servers
        3. Works with Starlette applications
        
        The async wrapper uses asyncio.to_thread() to run synchronous
        operations in a thread pool, making it non-blocking.
